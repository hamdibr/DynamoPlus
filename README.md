# DynamoPlus
Run EnergyPlus from Dynamo

## What's it about?

DynamoPlus was developed to have the ability to link Dynamo geometry, either native or derived from Revit, to the Energy Plus simulation engine. It is not designed for things like sizing mechanical equipment, though it might be included in future releases.
